## Feature List

* Better Terminal (queue clicks; drag click)
* Corpse Finder (mineshaft)
* Map Marker (purely visual block replacement)
* Mining Prediction (shows when you should aim at the next block)
* Raw Input (JInput / Native Win32 implementations)
* SS Motion Blur (based on screenshot instead of shader; can be used with Fast Render; little performance impact)
* YC Leap Menu (5-grid ring-shaped menu; differs from most leap menus; leap hotkeys)
* Window Properties (borderless window; windowed fullscreen; custom window title)
* Hotkeys (separate keys for drop single item / item stack)
* Cursor (cursor trail)
* Tweaks (features that modify vanilla slightly)
    * Enable Instant Aim (fix aiming being delayed for 1 tick)
    * Disable Pearl Click-On-Block Packet (commonly called Cancel Interact; makes you able to throw pearls while aiming
      at a block on most SkyBlock islands)
    * Disable NBT Update Reset Digging on SkyBlock Mining Islands (a feature backport from new versions of Minecraft)

## Other Things I Want To Say

If you encounter a bug that crashes your game and can be stably reproduced, please report in issues and I'll fix as soon
as I can.

Feature requests will NOT be accepted easily because I made this mod for myself. I won't add features I don't need or
there's a better option for the feature in every aspect. If you would like to commit a pull request, please ask if I
would merge in the issues before you actually do that. (Feel free to fork as long as you follow GPLv2)

To code this mod, I learned many new things for the first time, such as Kotlin, Mixin, Gradle, Git, GUI design and so
on. Maybe it's not good, but I'm trying my best. Hope you enjoy.
